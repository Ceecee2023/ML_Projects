## Overview
In this project, we utilize the Torch deep learning library along with several R packages to perform image classification on chest X-rays. The aim is to accurately diagnose pneumonia by training a CNN model.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of chest X-ray images of pediatric patients, sourced from the Guangzhou Women and Childrenâ€™s Medical Center. The images are categorized into two classes: normal and pneumonia (bacterial and viral). Quality control was performed to ensure the dataset's integrity.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to install the following R packages:
```R
# Install necessary packages
install.packages("gridExtra")
install.packages("jpeg")
install.packages("imager")
install.packages("magick")
install.packages("torch")
install.packages("torchvision")
install.packages("luz")

# Install Bioconductor package (if not already installed)
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("EBImage")
install.packages("abind")
```

## Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps involve loading the images, normalizing pixel values, and resizing them to a consistent size of 224x224 pixels. The code for preprocessing is encapsulated in the `process_images` function.

## Model Training
We define a CNN model using the `torch` package, train it on the preprocessed data, and validate its performance. The model architecture includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics. The learning curves for training and validation are plotted to visualize the model's progress.

## Data Augmentation
To improve the model's robustness, data augmentation techniques such as random rotations, flips, and changes in brightness and contrast are applied.

## Transfer Learning
We utilize the pre-trained MobileNet model for transfer learning to enhance the performance of our image classification task.

## Results
The trained model is evaluated on the test set to assess its ability to accurately classify the X-rays into normal and pneumonia categories. The performance metrics and learning curves are documented.
